# Image Setup Notes

## Current Images (Loaded Automatically)

✅ **Hero Background**: `hero-background.png` - Packed cocktail bar event with industrial ceiling  
✅ **Venue/Terrace**: `venue-terrace.png` - Rooftop terrace with Newcastle skyline  
✅ **Pizza/Food**: `pizza-food.jpg` - Byker Slice pepperoni pizza  
✅ **DJ/Soundtrack**: `dj-party.png` - Bar interior with DJ booth visible  
✅ **Extra**: `bar-interior.jpeg` - Alternative bar shot (not currently used)

## Still Needed

⚠️ **Host Photos**: Need TWO individual portrait-style photos of the birthday hosts
- Should be stylized/cool portraits
- Currently: Placeholders with drag-and-drop enabled
- Suggestion: Use AI to separate and stylize the individual hosts from the beach photo
- Or: Take new individual portraits with better lighting/styling

## How to Add/Replace Images

1. **Via Drag & Drop** (temporary, browser only):
   - Open `index.html` in browser
   - Drag images directly onto placeholder areas
   - Images stored in browser memory only

2. **Permanent Method** (recommended):
   - Save individual host photos as `images/host1.jpg` and `images/host2.jpg`
   - Update `index.html` to reference these files (see other sections as examples)

## Next Steps for Faces in Existing Photos

Several venue photos contain people's faces that should be swapped/blurred:
- `hero-background.png` - Crowd faces visible
- `dj-party.png` - Bartender visible
- Consider using AI face replacement or privacy blurring before final deployment
